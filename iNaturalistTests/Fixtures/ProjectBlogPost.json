  "title": "Coyote Behavior in Winter (November - March)",
  "body": "It is not uncommon for coyote sightings to increase during the winter months in Wisconsin. In parks and natural areas, foliage is sparse so it may be easier to see coyotes moving throughout their environment. Although urban coyotes are primarily active during dawn and dusk in order to avoid human interactions, the winter season presents challenges to a coyote’s typical routine. Because their main food sources such as rodents and wild vegetation are harder to come by in winter, coyotes may expend extra energy to locate food sources elsewhere. Sometimes, the search for food leads a normally wary coyote to try their luck in our neighborhoods. As we prepare our yards for the winter season, it is a great opportunity to “coyote-proof” the perimeter of our homes. Discourage coyote activity by securing the lids on all garbage bins and replacing any carts that are easily accessible to wildlife. Never leave food scraps outdoors for wildlife, and do not feed your pets outdoors. Keep the ground below bird feeders clean from debris that attract squirrels and rodents, which in turn may attract coyotes. Especially at night, it may be best to accompany your pets when they need to go outdoors.\r\n\r\nWinter can also be a time of new pack formations for some coyotes, although this is dependent on available resources and populations in a territory. Transient coyotes from previous litters may seek out a mate and become established in a new space. Mated pairs typically display courtship behavior and may become defensive of their mate, particularly during the height of mating season in January and February. Though they will not use a den until a litter is born, coyotes may begin to select or create new dens and may monitor these areas closely as pup season nears. When visiting parks and other natural areas, exercise regular caution especially in an area with known coyote activity. If you come across a pair of coyotes at a comfortable distance, give them their space and leave the area. If a coyote comes too close, haze the coyote to keep their natural fear of humans intact. It is especially important to make sure that dogs are always on leash so that they do not chase wildlife or investigate a coyote’s space during this time of protectiveness.\r\n",
